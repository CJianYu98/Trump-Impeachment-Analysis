It must be strict and brad in inclusive of all events occurred , what\u2019s said and done by him or as a result of what he said or implied .  There is no trial without evidences and witnesses . There is no \u201cEmpty decision\u201d as conviction must be reached with different degrees . If we don\u2019t do so , we will be asking every next president to violate the constitution, abuse the people and office , incite on sedition for his/her personal interest to stay in power instead of accepting the law , and respecting the people\u2019s voice. Plus we will be asking the next president to ask for his impeachment , as it will result in nothing.",

The magnitude, influence and weight of the misconduct is what being addressed against him/her , everything else is a \u201cwork around\u201d on the fringe. - The United States vs Nixon and the Clinton vs Jones support it , while the Nixon vs Fitzgerald was controversial as it contradicted the USvNixon case.",

Subpoena the president , or his office documents, is granted by U.S vs Nixon U.S Supreme case which will serve Congress or Judicial branch in executing their job. \n\nJudicial and congressional hearings, trials and decisions, is supposed to be based on spirit of the constitution to protect its core establishment by the framers . 1.

        "text": "The debatable argument that a president is immune from incitement  has no ground as the United States vs Nixon decided other wise , and his lawyers who argued the decision didn\u2019t extend to indictment , but it was a myth and manipulation of wordings , because it\u2019s implied decision . But as of now if serving in office, POTUS is considered immune from criminal incitement ; hence Former POTUS is not immune from any indictment, trials as long as he Is not anymore in office.  In Trump case his impeachment started when he was in office , by him finishing his term because he was voted out , doesn\u2019t mean the case is closed . It means the impeachment hearings need to tried  by Senate . Presidents are the one who sets on official chairs . Their jobs is to serve the country , and not abuse the office or the chair . They are not equal , the president is changeable , but the chair and office are not .",
