With government running healthcare and so on, you have no choice. If you don\u2019t like Amazon, you don\u2019t buy stuff off Amazon and go somewhere else. You don\u2019t get a choice when government runs it. People point to the Nordic countries, but they are capitalist with social safety nets. They actually have a lower capital gains tax and corporate tax rate then America. But they also tax their citizens at an average of 50%. Now, could you provide for yourself if the government took 50% of your money every week? The rich people would end up moving their wealth to other countries and the jobs the rich people provide to other countries unless they set up lower investment taxes like in the Nordic countries which is unlikely to happen.
