If people want to vote by mail as we have been doing since the civil war, they should. If ballot boxes are being taken away especially in black neighborhoods like they did in Houston, or polling places are closed down in black neighborhoods on the day of the vote forcing people to travel and stay in long lines how is that not suppression. Make voting easier not harder. I don\u2019t mind a FREE state issued voter ID for all on voting rolls w/o a other IDs in exchange for a national voting holiday so more people don\u2019t have to work in the middle of the week vs exercise their right to vote. Also 1 person 1 vote means the elimination of the electoral college. The people should decide who wins, not electors. I am the elector when I vote. You are the elector when you vote. Yes. 1 person, ONE vote.",
