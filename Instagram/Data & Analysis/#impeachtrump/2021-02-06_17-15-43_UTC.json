It was bleeding profusely.\n\n\u201cI was so scared. There was a lot of blood flowing,\u201d he added. \u201cI knew from watching movies that most of the people die because of lots of blood lost. I was so afraid of dying.\u201d\n\nQuintana was on his way to work in Harlem around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday when a man in a Louis Vuitton mask walked by and kicked the tote bag he had set on the train floor. \u201cI said, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019 and I went toward the door to get away from him,\u201d he said.\n\nQuintana shifted away from the assailant, but the man just kicked his bag again before taking a box-cutter knife to Quintana\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI asked for someone to help me, but nobody came,\u201d he said.\n\nQuintana got out at the next stop and went to an MTA booth, where a worker dialed 911. Medics later took him to Bellevue Hospital for treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from cheek to cheek,\u201d Quintana said of the long, horizontal gash that stretches right under his nose.\n\nThe attacker ran off the train as soon as the doors opened at the 1st Ave. stop, officials said. It wasn\u2019t clear if the assailant intentionally kicked the bag or did so accidentally.\n\nCops released surveillance images of the suspect Thursday and asked for the public\u2019s help tracking him down. He\u2019s described as between 20 and 30, wearing a black North Face jacket, red hoodie, blue jeans, a red bandanna and light-colored sneakers....
