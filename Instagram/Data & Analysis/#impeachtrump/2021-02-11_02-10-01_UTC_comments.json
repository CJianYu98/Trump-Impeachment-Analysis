Also calling detention centers \u201cconcentration camps\u201d and the sitting president of the United States Hitler is inciting violence, tell me, what do you feel when you hear \u201cconcentration camp\u201d or \u201cHitler\u201d? You think those institutions or person should be brought down with violence. This is dangerous rhetoric and easily leads to things like what happened just a few days ago, a blm rally turned violent in Washington DC, in which the 6,000+ national guardsmen stationed in our capitol like we\u2019re North Korea, did not help the officers assaulted",
