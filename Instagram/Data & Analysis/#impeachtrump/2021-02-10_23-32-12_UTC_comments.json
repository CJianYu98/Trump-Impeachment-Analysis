Trump should never hold office again and neither should any Republican Senator that refuses to hold him accountable.  It was bad enough knowing what went on in the Capitol before today, but the timelines, the tweets, the videos presented in this trial... they make it clear:  Donald Trump FAILED to act like he even knew what a President WAS, let alone what a President DOES when the seat of Government is in a full on PLANNED attack that HIS ADMINISTRATION  knew was COMING through website postings they MONITORED!!! An attack he TWEETED THROUGH!!! That it took him not seconds to act... not minutes to act... it took Donald John Trump HOURS to do ANYTHING even remotely PRESIDENTIAL!  Far too LITTLE!!! Far too LATE!!! The House of Representatives did their job!  Senate... DO YOURS!!!",
