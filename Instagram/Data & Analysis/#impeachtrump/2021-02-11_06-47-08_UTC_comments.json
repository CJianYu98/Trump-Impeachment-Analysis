No of course these are real shepherds and sheep dogs\u2026 I\u2019m using them as an analogy to point out what was happening. The Republicans Party needed the masses to fall into line in order to get their plan executed. The mindless drones that think and talk nonsense Were primed and not just with the speeches that day but with months of them before even the election\u2026 They were primed to attack the Capitol. I don\u2019t think that 4 1/2 years of brainwashing was done just for that very moment January 6 but it was done so they would have a available gullible army if they needed it. The Maga colt should be insulted\u2026 But of course they\u2019re not capable of even admitting their leader is a loser and use them to even feel insulted",
