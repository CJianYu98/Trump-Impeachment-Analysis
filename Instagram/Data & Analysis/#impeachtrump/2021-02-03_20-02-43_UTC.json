                        "text": "Posted @withregram \u2022 @nytimes Prosecutors said six cases showed that Derek Chauvin, the officer charged in George Floyd's death, used excessive force as far back as 2015 when he restrained people \u2014 several by their necks or by kneeling on top of them \u2014 as he did in arresting Floyd. \n \nNearly three years before Chauvin knelt on Floyd, Zoya Code found herself in a similar position: handcuffed facedown on the ground, with Chauvin\u2019s knee on her.\n \nThe officer had answered a call of a domestic dispute at her home, and Code said he forced her down when she tried to pull away.\n \n\u201cHe just stayed on my neck,\u201d Code said, ignoring her desperate pleas to get off. Frustrated and upset, she challenged him to press harder. \u201cThen he did. Just to shut me up,\u201d she said.\n \nHer case was one of the six arrests that the Minnesota Attorney General\u2019s office sought to introduce in the case against Chauvin, arguing that they showed how he was using excessive force when he restrained people. Police records show that Chauvin was never formally reprimanded for any of these incidents, even though at least two of those arrested said they had filed formal complaints.\n \nOf the six people arrested, two were Black, one was Latino and one was Native American. The race of two others was not included in the arrest reports that reporters examined.\n \nDiscussing the encounters publicly for the first time in interviews with The Marshall Project, three people who were arrested by Chauvin and a witness in a fourth incident described him as an unusually rough officer who was quick to use force and callous about their pain. Tap the link in our bio to read more about the interviews, which provide new insight into the history of a police officer whose handling of Floyd\u2019s arrest led to months of protests in dozens of cities.\n\n#KeepingUpWithGrissey #NYCNews #NYPD #Racism #ThisIsAmerica #StimulusProposal #StimulusBill #AmericanRescuePlan  #Impeachment #ImpeachTrump #LocalNews #NewsFromTheUSA #ExplorePage #CovidNews #CoronaVirus #Covid19 #PoliticalNews #CapitolProtest #BLM #BreakingNewsUpdates #DonaldTrump #JoeBiden #UpToTheTime #UpToTheMinute #KeepUpWithAllThe411 #NewsBlog #UpToTheTime #Inauguration"
