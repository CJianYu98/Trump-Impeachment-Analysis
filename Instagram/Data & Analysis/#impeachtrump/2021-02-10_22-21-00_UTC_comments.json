Jeez, that tells me how out of touch you are. Try living in Cali. Look up Senate Bill 1391. That's an amendment that the liberal legislature unconstitutionally made to a proposition the voters passed. The liberal state AG refused to challenge so the county DAs had to do all their own work. Every single appeals court except for one county ruled against them. Thanks to that one county the CA Supreme Court is now deciding the matter. The judge's political color absolutely matters. If it didn't you wouldn't be so upset about the judges Trump appointed to the federal courts and the Supreme Court. There are good honest judges, and then there are partisan hack judges. The dissenting opinion from Wisconsin made that LOUD and clear. \ud83d\ude12 I can't roll my eyes hard enough.",
