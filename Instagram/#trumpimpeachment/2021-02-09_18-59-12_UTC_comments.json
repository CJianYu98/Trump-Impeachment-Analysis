The people\u2019s representatives spoke and impeached him. This is the trial to see what will be done about it. To investigate the grounds for impeachment to see if a crime was committed. Let me put it this way. So if after a doctor retires we find out while he was a doctor he may have killed patients in his care... he should not be held accountable, investigated  or tried for possible crimes committed while a doctor? Or if after a cop retires we find out he may have killed people unjustly... we let him walk? We do not investigate? A president is not above the law. And because we\u2019ve created an over powered executive this is the only method we have investigating a president who may have committed crimes while in office. And unless you are a constitutional scholar I\u2019m going to side with the two dozen or so scholars that have said, yes, a president can be tried while out of office. Trump attempted to overthrow a free and fair election. That is sedition in this country. And it is a crime.",

You believe everyone else is lying but one man is always telling you the \u201ctruth.\u201d Trump lied about the Pandemic. He claimed CoVID19 was just a flu. He claimed it would just go away. He made bogus claims about Hydroxychloroquine. He held maskless rallies that spread the disease and killed people. He forced states to bid against each other for PPE\u2019s driving up costs. He contradicted his own infectious disease experts sowing chaos. MAGA cultists believe the WHO, the CDC, NIH, Johns Hopkins, and thousands of infectious disease expert are ALL lying. Then. He lied about election fraud. He made crazy claims with no evidence and lost 59 straight court challenges. His lawyers quit. Eventually they stopped even arguing fraud in court because of threats of disbarment. The election was certified in all 50 states. It was the most secure, observed and transparent election in US history. In order to square with the lies Trump tells you you have to believe the whole world and almost all media is conspired against you. He lies so totally and casually it\u2019s impossible to keep track.

However you should not impeach a person who used to hold office that you suspect committed a crime. If you suspect they committed a crime then you should hold a criminal trial not an impeachment. The whole purpose of the current impeachment is to keep Trump from running again in 2024. And that is wrong.",
