        "text": "I can\u2019t imagine EVeR posting anything like the vicious and evil propagation about a Democratic that you post. In 2008 prior to Barack Obama being elected, my neighbor of 20 years found out that I was a libertarian. She did not talk to me for over 6 months. When Barrack Obama got elected, I congratulated her on him being elected. Would someone like you ever congratulate a conservative on their candidate being elected. I highly doubt. The Democrats need Republican\u2019s and visa versa. This creates a counter balance so that our country doesn\u2019t become like Russia. That is not hyperbole. Go read The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn if you are curious where socialism ends. I listened on Audible because the book is SUPER long. One thinks they know how bad situations can get, or how evil people are, have never read a book like this. A good beginning would be to start applying the same standards to your side instead of only the conservative side. I call out the Conservative party all the time. I am not a sheep. I believe in critical thinking. I say drop the hate that you have. Your side won. You have the Presidency, the House, and the Senate.",
