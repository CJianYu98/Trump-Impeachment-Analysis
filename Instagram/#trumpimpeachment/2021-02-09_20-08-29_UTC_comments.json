You clearly don\u2019t know anything, and you clearly are blindly supporting a man who once said that he could (in reference to women) \u201cgrab \u2018em by the pussy\u201d and that he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Ave and shoot somebody\u201d and not lose any voters. Let me quickly reference a segment from a Washington Post article that, hopefully, your withered mind can comprehend, \u201cMost noted that the chief aim of impeachment is to remove someone for abuse of power, which is off the table once an official is no longer in office. But the impeachment process also allows for Congress to prevent someone who might have committed high crimes and misdemeanors from holding office again \u2014 which could give motivation for those facing impeachment to resign early so as not to face that sanction.\u201d (WP) and with that, and your capable ability to find my profile out of millions (you saucy minx), I\u2019d recommend giving a quick peruse of the actual constitution. I\u2019m not gonna spend time giving you a lesson, because I paid for the classes that I learned that in, but I\u2019d think one would wish to begin research (assuming it is your desire to understand both the constitution and the tensile ability of impeachment) with William Belknap\u2019s case in 1876. Once you\u2019re done with that, read the Magna Carta. If you don\u2019t know what the Magna Carta is, then I think you should fuck off. Because you don\u2019t know what your talking about. \nSchool House Rock also gives thorough study in government and politics btw. It\u2019s on YouTube.\n\nSide note: when the original articles of his SECOND impeachment were brought, Republican Senator and then Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he wouldn\u2019t even think about impeachment until the day trump left office. So.....?",

Because it\u2019s absurd. The shenanigans pulled by the republicans were and are absurd. There is no place in the constitution that says you cannot not impeach a former government official. In fact, in the beginning, it was ex-gov officials who reckoned with impeachment. Kindly, come up in here with zero knowledge, zero history, and zero sense trying to argue that musty old defense. trumps lawyers tried it yesterday, and they looked foolish. A bipartisan vote proved that. Farewell!",
